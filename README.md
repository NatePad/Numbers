# Nate's Calculator and Random Number Generator

As a board gamer, I'm making this app in order to crate a random number generator, which is frequently used in various board games in the form of dice rolls and card shuffles. The live version of this app is hosted by GitHub pages at [https://natepad.github.io/Random-Number-Generator/](natepad.github.io/Random-Number-Generator).
